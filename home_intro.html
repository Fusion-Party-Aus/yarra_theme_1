<h2>Bridgid's Policies:<br /><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px;">Bridgid&rsquo;s policies as councillor for 2024-2028:&nbsp;</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Revisit the bin tax</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">: It&rsquo;s purely about revenue raising instead of environmental concerns. It&rsquo;s going up to 30% on your next rates bill and is not a fair system. Bridgid will replace the &ldquo;user pays&rdquo; system with a communal approach to waste management</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stop corruption on council</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">: we need to fix planning by bringing back residents&rsquo; ability to object to inappropriate development.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stop corruption on council</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">: council is spending far too much money on consultants and senior management. We also need to invest in more efficient in-house services</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Transparency and governance</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">: restore community&rsquo;s ability to participate in council meetings.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heritage</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">: protect heritage values and maintain neighbourhood character</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Environment</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Yarra Council&rsquo;s &ldquo;nature strategy&rdquo; has been merged into the climate emergency strategy which is important but means we are not paying proper attention to biodiversity and riverine habitats</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Environment</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Bridgid will ensure the nature and biodiversity strategy is properly resourced, including the &ldquo;Gardens for Wildlife&rdquo; program</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Socially progressive</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Bridgid is a lifelong feminist who aims to get more women into politics and is heavily inspired by Monique Ryan and Helen Haines from the Community Independents Project</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Transport</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Yarra Council&rsquo;s proposed parking policy will remove all angled parking due to safety concerns. Instead, Bridgid proposes that we restructure angled parking to be &lsquo;back-in angle parking&rsquo;, which is safer while maintaining the same amount of car spots for existing residents, with a gentle hand to encourage the use of cycling and scooters.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Housing affordability and living standards: </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bridgid advocates for more high quality housing which are well constructed and suitable for families (especially when it comes to apartments), more action to be taken on reducing Vacant properties &amp; Land Banking, and a portion should be set aside for fully public housing rather than misleading &ldquo;affordable&rdquo; housing (and without knocking down existing public housing).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><em><span>Planning:</span></em><span> Apartment tower developers should be made to purchase shadowing rights from owners or tenants who are impacted by the loss of sunlight/amenity. More developments should be approved where appropriate, so that more people can enjoy the City of Yarra including keeping families close, and to keep the state government at bay - planning decisions should be kept local, led by the residents who are actually affected by it.</span></li>
